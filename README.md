##if you tired from react projects setup or you even dont know to to setup a react project, well this python project is for you

How to install it ? just paste these commands ito your termminal !
```
mkdir MYProjects && cd MYProjects
git clone https://github.com/omer-os/quick_start_to_react_project_with_python.git
```

so whenever you want to create a new react project just go to the MYProjects directory which created on you pc 
and just write this on your termminal in MYProjects directory
```
python start.py
```


what will script do ?
1- it will create a new react project 
2- it will delete unneccesery files in src and public directories automaticaly
3- it will open the react project in the browser
4- it will open it in the vscode


THIS WORKS ONLY IN WINDOWS MACHIENS FOR NOW

im using this script for all of my projects


if you dont have python install it from https://python.org
if you dont have git install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads
if you dont have node install it from https://nodejs.org
if you dont have react install it by pasting this on your termminal
```
